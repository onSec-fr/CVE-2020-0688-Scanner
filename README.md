## How to use

git clone https://github.com/onSec-fr/CVE-2020-0688-Scanner.git
```

#### Disclaimer
This tool has been developed to test your own system or for authorized security testing. Make sure you check with your local laws before running this tool.

#### Limitations
Since Exchange 2013, only the first 3 parts of the version number can be retrieved in this way. This means that sometimes it is possible that the server is flagged as patched when it is not if it has the very last minor version number.  
In case the server is vulnerable, the scan is 100% reliable!
