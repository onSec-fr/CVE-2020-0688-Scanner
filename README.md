## How to use

### Prerequisite
  - Windows
  - .NET framework 4.5.2

#### Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/onSec-fr/CVE-2020-0688-Scanner.git
```
#### Run
```bash
./CVE-2020-0688-Scanner.exe [path_to_input_file]
```
Note : the input file can contain ip addresses, hostnames and FQDN.

#### Limitations
Since Exchange 2013, only the first 3 parts of the version number can be retrieved in this way. This means that sometimes it is possible that the server is flagged as patched when it is not if it has the very last minor version number.
In case the server is vulnerable, the scan is 100% reliable!
